# Textbooks-Inventory

Here is HTML and CSS files for a textbook inventory website for SFU.  The website contains at least three pages: the main page, the business textbook inventory page, and the computing science inventory page.

When resizing the window to less than 550px, the sections labelled “Textbooks” and “Main Menu” will be displayed vertically.
Extra information will be dynamically displayed when you hover over each of the faculties.

Hovering over the individual pictures in business and computer science page will create a shadow effect.
Pictures will be displayed four per row, with some space between them. When resizing the window and the width of the window is less than or equal to 770px, only two pictures per row should be shown; when the window is less than or equal to 480px, only one picture per row will be shown.
Each faculty inventory page have a link that leads back to the main menu labelled with the text
